GetShop ecommerce is a plugin to import all products / product lists from you GetShop account.

== Description ==

GetShop ecommerce helps you sell you products using a wordpress site. It is super easy to install and start using. All you have to do is activate this plugin and use the two different shortcodes.

Example for importing a product list:
[productlist id="6c7eb8ff-bf92-4622-814b-19523919c24f"]

Example for importing a product:
[product id="37209802-6426-4a0f-a795-f4a429f4cc00"]

It integrates into most designs and our goal is to have it working for all of them, so let us know if it looks bad in any cases.

Since this is a plugin importing products from getshop, you will notice that all the data is located at your account at getshop.

GetShop also handles all the payment information, email notification, order history, product manipulation for you, so all this plugin is doing is to provide you with the necessary information to convert your word press site into an eCommerce solution where you can sell your products.

Short summary of what is happening:
1. Whenever a product is sold, you will find the order history inside of your GetShop account.
2. Whenever a product is loaded, the data is loaded from your getshop account.
3. All payment methods activated is the same payment methods activated in your GetShop account (and processed by GetShop).
4. You create the products at your getshop account, and import them into your wordpress site.
